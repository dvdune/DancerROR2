## Dancer Beta

`1.11.113`
- fixed plasma breath issue with attack speed
- heavier hit sounds, especially on crits or against low health enemies.

adds ridley as a survivor (beta)

if you are playing multiplayer, the least buggy experience is if the ridley player is the host. otherwise i dont recommend playing ridley with a group.

missing a lot of visuals. for now i highly recommend using TimeSweeper's hitboxviewer mod to get familiar with hitboxes and Harb's DebugToolkit because its because .

i strongly encourage you to find me in the ROR2 modding discord, my username is orbeezeater22#0704
let me know how gameplay feels since that is the focus of the beta!

`1.7.11` 
minor adjustments to most abilities, should flow together nicer overall. not all of these changes are listed. big buff to Space Pirate Rush (SPR)
- slightly lowered base damage of SPR but increased its scaling with velocity. moving fast or dropping from heights should do noticeably more damage, especially to bosses.
- SPR now stuns better, most importantly stopping the attacks of greater wisps and brass contraptions
- plasma breath charges faster and no longer has intense falloff, but damage lowered
- added vertical launch to nair
- skewering enemies from above or below should move them in front of you better. functions better while midair

- started work on vfx. only on some abilities for now

`1.6.10`
- added hitstop to most moves
- damage increase all around
- added effects to Space Pirate Rush (SPR)
- SPR damage when colliding with bosses increased bigly and scales with movespeed

- SPR stops dragging when not grounded, meaning falling off a cliff during the drag will cause another impact when hitting the ground
- temp vfx for skewer

- capped passive dmg reduction
- made some stuff louder

`1.2.3`
