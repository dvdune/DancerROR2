## Ridley Beta



`1.6.10`
- added hitstop to most moves
- damage increase all around
- added effects to Space Pirate Rush (SPR)
- SPR damage when colliding with bosses increased bigly and scales with movespeed
- SPR damage when hitting the ground increased and scales with time spent in the air
- SPR stops dragging when not grounded, meaning falling off a cliff during the drag will cause another impact when hitting the ground
- temp vfx for skewer

adds ridley as a survivor (beta)

missing a lot of visuals. for now i highly recommend using TimeSweeper's hitboxviewer mod to get familiar with hitboxes and Harb's DebugToolkit because its because .

i strongly encourage you to find me in the ROR2 modding discord, my username is orbeezeater22#0704
let me know how gameplay feels since that is the focus of the beta!
